  <p><i> Trying to leave a better world for our kids,<br>
         and better kids for our world ツ</i></p>
  
  <p>
  Howdy! My name is Alexander.
  I consider myself a generalist, passionate about using teaching, research, and engineering to help folks.
  I love teaching, preparing assignments and presentations that enhance learning experiences.
  I’m very fortunate to teach analytical methods and GIS for landscape architecture and urban planning students.
  I strive to make each semester a great and special one; my goal is to equip students with fundamental research methods while fostering their analytical thinking and programming skills.
  I know that it might feel challenging, but these are important tools for researchers and planners.
  Whether it’s exploring data, modeling scenarios, or creating visualizations, statistics and spatial analysis empower informed and impactful decisions.
  I encourage students to keep experimenting and asking questions; the more they practice, the more confident they become. After all, every expert was once a beginner.
  I’m a coding and reproducible research enthusiast, committed to employ and promote the use of open-source software and publicly available data to enhance collaboration and make education and research more accessible and transparent.

  <h3>Short bio</h3>
  <p>
  Alexander Abuabara received his B.Sc. in Civil Engineering from the University of São Paulo (Brazil, 2001),
  his M.Sc. in Production Engineering from the Federal University of São Carlos (Brazil, 2006), applying mixed integer programming to multi-period planning of a cutting-stocking problem,
  and his Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Science from Texas A&M University (USA, 2022), exploring applications of Bayesian networks in urban planning.
  He has worked on forecasting models and logistics for one of the world’s largest citrus juice companies (2002–2005)
  and contributed to the TAMU/TTI/USACE Hurricane Evacuation Studies team (2015–2025),
  supporting the modeling of hazard exposure, household evacuation behavior, and the design of evacuation zones for planning and risk mitigation in Texas coastal counties.
  Before joining the faculty in 2022, he worked as a NIST-funded postdoctoral research associate at Texas A&M University, modeling federal individual assistance.
  During the 2024–2025 academic year, he served as Faculty Senator for the College of Architecture.
  Dr. Abuabara teaches research and analytical methods and GIS, aiming to enhance students' analytical thinking and programming skills.
  He is currently preparing a textbook to enhance his teaching on Bayesian statistics and probabilistic analysis using influence diagrams.
  His interests include risk modeling and decision-making analysis to better understand irrational beliefs.

  <h3>Teaching statement</h3>
  <p>
  Teaching has always been one of the most energizing parts of my work, whether training colleagues, mentoring students, or leading my own classes.
  I teach and write educational content to make statistics and probability easier for everybody.
  I genuinely want to be a great teacher, and that means always learning, adapting, and getting better.
  I've had semesters that were very good and others that were more difficult.
  Every group of students is different and what worked once might not work again.
  In my teaching, I strive for a structured yet dynamic environment that empowers students through guided autonomy and collaborative learning.
  I prioritize hands-on activities, applied learning that connects students to real-world problems and industries through applied projects, aiming to build both competence and confidence.    
  My teaching philosophy is grounded in an authentic, sincere desire to be an outstanding educator who adapts, learns, and improves with every experience.
  For me, teaching extends beyond lectures; it includes mentoring, fostering peer learning, and creating opportunities for students to build meaningful portfolios and professional identities.
  Teaching isn’t just about delivering content; it’s about being present, responsive, and committed to the growth of each student.
