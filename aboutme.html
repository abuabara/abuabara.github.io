  <p><i> Trying to leave a better world for our kids,<br>
         and better kids for our world ツ</i></p>
  
  <p>
  Howdy! My name is Alexander.
  I consider myself a generalist, passionate about using teaching, research, and engineering to help folks.
  I love teaching, preparing assignments and presentations that enhance learning experiences.
  I’m very fortunate to teach, striving to make every semester a special one and providing students essential research methods, analytical thinking, and programming skills.
  I know that it might feel challenging but these are very important tools for engineers and researchers.
  Whether it’s exploring data, modeling scenarios, or creating visualizations, data analysis empower informed and impactful decisions.
  I encourage students to keep experimenting and asking questions; the more they practice, the more confident they become.
  After all, every expert was once a beginner.
  I’m a coding, reproducible research enthusiast, committed to employ and promote the use of open-source software and open data to enhance collaboration and make education and research more accessible and transparent.

  <h3>Short bio</h3>
  <p>
  Alexander Abuabara is an educator and academic dedicated to applying systems thinking to support better decision-making.
  He received his B.S. degree in Civil Engineering from the University of São Paulo (Brazil, 2001),
  and completed his M.S. in Production Engineering from the Federal University of São Carlos (Brazil, 2006)
  with a thesis researching a practical application of mixed-integer programming to a multi-period planning of a cutting-stock problem.
  Alexander received his Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Science from Texas A&M University (USA, 2022)
  with a dissertation exploring how Bayesian networks can support decision-making in urban planning.
  Before joining the Wm Michael Barnes '64 Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering in the Fall 2025,
  Alexander taught research and analytical methods and GIS as a Instructional Assistant Professor (2024–2025) and Graduate Research Assistance and Lecturer (2017-2022) in the Department of Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning at Texas A&M,
  where he worked with both undergraduate and graduate students and served as Faculty Senator for the College of Architecture during the 2024–2025 academic year.
  In addition to other research activities and academic work,
  Alexander held a postdoctoral research associate appointment funded by NIST (2022–2024) where he structured data and built models for federal assistance after large disasters,
  and, also, contributed to the modeling of forecasting models for one of the world's largest citrus juice companies (2002–2005).
  Alexander has been a proud member of the Hurricane Evacuation Studies team (TAMU/TTI/USACE, 2015–2025),
  supporting efforts in modeling hazard exposure and household evacuation behavior,
  and developing evacuation zones to enhance planning and risk mitigation in Texas coastal counties.
  Alexander is currently preparing a textbook to enhance his teaching of Bayesian statistics and probabilistic analysis using influence diagrams.
  His academic interests include examining irrational beliefs in risk modeling and helping students apply data to real-world decision making, with a particular focus on Bayesian inference.

  <h3>Expertise</h3>
  <p>
  Alexander Abuabara expertise centers on Bayesian statistics, systems thinking, and analytical decision-making under uncertainty.
  His research uses probabilistic causal analysis, particularly through influence diagrams and Bayesian networks,
  to evaluate risks related to natural hazards and their social impacts such as hurricane evacuation planning and mental health consequences.
  He is also involved in community-based participatory research that supports resilience and evidence-informed policy.
  These efforts are complemented by his work in spatial analysis, where he integrates geographic data to enhance understanding of complex urban and environmental systems.
  Looking ahead, he is interested in exploring how irrational beliefs and cognitive biases shape decision-making processes,
  particularly in high-stakes or uncertain environments, as part of a broader investigation into the psychological dimensions of risk and resilience.

  <h3>Teaching statement</h3>
  <p>
  Teaching has always been one of the most energizing parts of my work, whether training colleagues, mentoring students, or leading my own classes.
  I teach and write educational content to make statistics and probability easier for everybody.
  Every semester is different and each group of students is unique; what worked once might not work again.
  I really want to be a great teacher and that means always learning, adapting, and getting better each and every day.
  My teaching philosophy is grounded in an authentic, sincere desire to be an outstanding educator who adapts, learns, and improves.
  A classroom should be a place where students feel safe, supported, and inspired to succeed.
  In my teaching, I work to create a structured yet dynamic environment that empowers students through guided autonomy and collaborative learning.  
  I prioritize hands-on activities, applied learning that connects students to real-world problems and industries through practical projects aiming to build both competence and confidence.
  Teaching has never been a simple job; it takes expertise and patience, creativity and heart.
  For me, teaching extends beyond lectures; it includes mentoring, fostering peer learning, and creating opportunities for students to build compelling portfolios and professional identities.
  Teaching isn’t just about delivering content; it’s about being present, responsive, and always be committed to the growth of each student.
